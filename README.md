## Generic Readme
Small set of features meant as kind of base mod.
Most of this is a port of Frontline features made years ago, but with some script updates.

Requires CBA_A3.

Current features:
* Suppression (VIsual effects for players. Please note that the effects of this one are a fair bit stronger than you might know from other mods)
* Aimsway (Mostly scope misalignment, that settles when keeping sights up)
* Earplugs (Extremely basic fadeSound script - Default keybind F1)
* Window break (Smashes window you're looking at - Default keybind T )

Please take a look in the Addon Options to tweak some stuff
Note that especially the Supression settings can change quite heavily how it acts, so don't get put everything to crazy values and then wonder why it's acting silly
